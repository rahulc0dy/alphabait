## About

AlphaBait is designed to engage young learners through interactive letters that combine visual, auditory, and
kinesthetic methods. By making each letter come alive on screen, learners can see, hear, and interact with the alphabet
in fun and memorable ways.

Extra features like gamification, augmented reality (AR), voice recording with feedback, and a parental dashboard ensure that learning stays engaging, trackable, and personalized.
